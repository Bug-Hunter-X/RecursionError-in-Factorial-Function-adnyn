This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a RecursionError caused by an improperly handled base case in a recursive function.  The `factorial_bug.py` file shows a factorial function that fails for negative input due to infinite recursion. The `factorial_solution.py` provides a corrected version that handles this case gracefully.  This is a frequent issue for beginners learning recursion and demonstrates the importance of defining a proper base case to avoid stack overflow errors.
